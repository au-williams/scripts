# Installation

These scripts can be stored anywhere on the filesystem with individual file shortcuts placed in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` to run on system startup.

## askey.ahk

Replaces hotstrings with their respective ascii emoticons because Discord and Slack are lacking in that department.

- _"Why would I want to use this?"_ — You don't.

- _"How do I use this?"_ — `.tf` -> `(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻`

## capslock.ahk

Hooks into the capslock key and replaces the original functionality with the configured hotkeys. I use this on every computer that has a keyboard.

## remote.ahk

Hooks into the face buttons on my [air mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Multifunctional-Compatible-Android-Keyboard-Wireless/dp/B01N1PD7BG/) to enhance compatibility with some Windows programs. I use this exclusively on my HTPC.
