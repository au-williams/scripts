# settings.json

This `settings.json` file is used with [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US).

Unfortunately, in typical Microsoft fashion, they made software that's \*so close\* to being great. Sort of like their _"video conferencing software"_ that doesn't support full-screen despite having a feature request that's old enough to enroll in grade school. If they ever implement that ticket it will be old enough to drive on the interstate.

According to [this StackOverflow thread](https://superuser.com/questions/1667853/how-to-change-the-location-of-settings-json-file-in-windows-terminal), you can't set a custom path for your `settings.json` file without making a symlink (yikes ü§¢). [Here's the feature request which has been idle since 2019](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/2933). If Microsoft Teams is any indication of what they think about customer feedback I suggest you learn to enjoy copy pasting the contents of this file.
