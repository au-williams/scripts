# settings.json

This `settings.json` file is used with Windows Terminal.

Unfortunately, in typical Microsoft fashion, they made software that's \*so close\* to being great. Sort of like their _"video conferencing software"_ that doesn't support full-screen despite having a feature request that's old enough to attend grade school. If they ever implement that ticket it will be old enough to drive on the interstate.

According to [this StackOverflow thread](https://superuser.com/questions/1667853/how-to-change-the-location-of-settings-json-file-in-windows-terminal) you can't set a custom path for your setting.json file without a symbolic link (yikes). [Here's the feature request which has been idle since 2019](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/2933). If Microsoft Teams is any indication of what they think about customer feedback I suggest you learn to have fun copy pasting the contents of this file.
